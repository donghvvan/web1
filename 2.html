          Hey, you, get off my cloud
          You don't know me, and you don't know my style
          Gettin' lifted, never coming down
          Gettin' lifted

          Gettin' dumb on the drum like rum-pum-pum-pum
          Better run, when I come, what a bomb bomb
          Sippin' on coke and rum, gettin' so drunk
          Everyone wonderin' where she come from?

          Got gold on my necklace, gold on my wrists
          Girls gettin' mad cause their boys want a kiss
          Fast with the cash, I just throw it in the bag
          Everything I wanna have (well I think you get the gist)

          Upside downside, inside outside
          Hittin' you from every angle there's no doubt
          Poetry in motion, coast to coast and
          Rub in in your skin like lotion

          I got myself a 40
          I got myself a shorty
          And I'm about to go get lifted
